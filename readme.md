"""Programming""" stuff from my teenage that I've found in an old HDD.

In these files you find some applications (with or without GUI), small utilities, incomplete code, english typos, amateur texts and translations from my teenage (11~16 years old). Actually there's no relevant code or softwares here, only old stuff that I've made with little to nothing knowledge on programming and software development.

The files are untouched since that epoch and I do not intend to delete, change, clean or even organize files or folders. You can laugh a lot while reading some of these files, so do not consider this as serious work. Just have created this repo for historical reasons (of course, for me).
